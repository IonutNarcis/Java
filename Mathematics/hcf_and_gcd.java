Factorial 
Find the trainling zero in the factorial

  int res=0
  for(int i=5;i<=n;i*=5){
      res = res + n/i;
  }
res is the answer 


1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 gives 38800
it has 2 fives in it where 2 and 5 are the responsible for the 0 caused in the end 
hence we use this method to fing the trialing zero
